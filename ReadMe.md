The module 13 challenge is a back end for my e-commerce website. 
The database information such as database name, MySQL username, and MySQL 
password are stored in the env file. A sample testing data is store in seeds 
file.name When the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to 
the MySQL database. The API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, 
or tags. The data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. 
WHEN the test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, it will create,
 update, and delete data in the database.
